# solana-tictactoe

I built this at the nyc solana hacker house. I initially planned to build a prediction market, but I got humbled real quick and spend most of the week building this 😂

The scaffolding was cloned from https://github.com/Arrowana/anchor-scaffold/tree/master/programs/escrow 

# Steps to run
start a solana test validator 
```
solana-test-validator
```

airdrop yourself some solana
```
solana airdrop 2 {address of phantom wallet}
```
build and deploy the solana program to localnet
```
anchor build && anchor deploy
```
